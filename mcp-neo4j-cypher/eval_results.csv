To determine the effect of this variant, additional contextual information such as the gene involved, the type of variant (e.g., missense, nonsense, silent), and functional studies are typically required. 

This specific variant is known to be associated with a SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the gene APOE (Apolipoprotein E), and the particular variant is often referred to as APOE Îµ4. The presence of the APOE Îµ4 allele is a well-known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. 

Individuals carrying one copy of the Îµ4 allele have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's, and carrying two copies of Îµ4 further increases that risk. However, it's important to note that having this variant does not guarantee the development of Alzheimer's, just as not having it does not ensure someone will not develop the disease â€“ it merely modifies the risk.
